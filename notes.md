- initial approach: pmem
  - drivers missing in some initramfs
  - adding hook to Arch
- switch to using actual storage (USB)
  - wider support
  - allows for caching :)
- starting with a CLI
  - evolved into TUI
  - select from list vs ask for it first
- network setup
  - do it within TUI -> becomes an app!
  - Wi-fi more complicated than just ethernet
